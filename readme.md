## Health Monitoring and Analysis

Health Monitoring and Analysis refers to the organized use of health data to observe and assess the health conditions of individuals or populations over a period. It includes a variety of activities, ranging from the real-time collection of physiological data (such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature) to the evaluation of more complex health information (like patient history, lifestyle habits, and genetic data). This repository focuses on Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python.

The problem addressed in this repository is my interpretation of a problem statement encountered at Statso (https://statso.io/healthcare-analysis-case-study/). The dataset we are working with includes the following columns:

    - PatientID: Numerical identifier for the patient.
    - Age: Age of the patient in years.
    - Gender: Gender of the patient.
    - HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.
    - BloodPressure: Blood pressure readings, formatted inconsistently.
    - RespiratoryRate: Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.
    - BodyTemperature: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.
    - ActivityLevel: Activity level at the time of the measurement.
    - OxygenSaturation: Oxygen saturation percentage.
    - SleepQuality: Quality of sleep reported by the patient.
    - StressLevel: Reported level of stress.
    - Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.

The dataset includes health metrics from 500 individuals, featuring variables such as age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation, recorded over a specific period. These variables provide a comprehensive snapshot of each patientâ€™s health status, which is crucial for monitoring and managing various health conditions.

### Problem Statement

Traditional health monitoring systems frequently rely on rigid, predefined thresholds to classify patient health status, which may not account for the nuanced variations in a diverse patient population. This approach can result in oversimplified assessments and might miss subtle but critical patterns within health data. The challenge is to create a more adaptive and responsive system that leverages unsupervised learning to discover natural clusters within health data, enabling more personalized and accurate health management

    - For the task of Health Monitoring and Analysis, our aim is to monitor the health of the patients in the data, analyze the patterns found in different types of patients and group them based on their health standards.

### Summary
Health Monitoring and Analysis encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, ranging from real-time collection of physiological data (such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature)to the more in-depth analysis of complex health records (including patient history, lifestyle factors, and genetic information).
